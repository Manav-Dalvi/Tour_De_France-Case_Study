# Tour De France - Case Study

### Abstract

Tour de France is the world’s most prestigious and most difficult bicycle race. 
It is held primarily in France while also occasionally passing through neighboring countries. 
Of the three foremost races; the others being Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a Espana, this event attracts the world’s best riders. 
The top cyclists from around the world compete in a grueling three-week 3,500 km journey each July that takes competitors through 
the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps and on to the finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. 
The Tour de France is broadcast worldwide on 121 different television channels in over 190 countries with huge audiences watching each stage, 
including a record 44 million viewers who took in one of the final stages in the 2009 race. 
It takes a massive effort to broadcast all the excitement to the millions of fans watching around the globe.


This case study aims to understand the database structure of this mega cycling event, Tour de France. Due to the sheer scale of the event, 
the database for this, also needs to be large and intricate.
We can understand the structure of it with the help of the Entity-Relationship diagram. 
The structure can be seen as a bulb-shaped diagram, where the base portrays the entities on the participation side of the event and the top 
of the bulb shows the organizational side of it.
We will go ahead with this analogy for the whole of this case study.
